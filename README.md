# NJF Astronomy

This is the source code for the [NJF Astronomy website](https://astronomy.njf.dev). It is where I share everything I am doing with astronomy and astrophotography. Currently, it is a collection of my astrophotos.

## Technologies

This project is made using Next.js, so it can be ran as expected:

```bash
# development
$ yarn dev

# building
$ yarn build

# run in production
$ yarn start
```

This project uses MDX, a JSX-infused flavor of markdown, for the pages. I use TailwindCSS for styles and NextUI for certain UI components, such as the Cards and Buttons.
