# NJF Astrophotography

Hi there, I am Nicholas Fasching, owner of [njf.dev](https://njf.dev). I am a programmer and made this website! I purchased a [Seestar S50 telescope](https://www.seestar.com/) back in January of 2024, and have more recently upgraded my setup, which is a work in progress (look for \"Shot on a Lumix S5IIX\"). I have always loved astronomy and space, and I hope you'll find this collection of my space photos as astonishing as I do.
