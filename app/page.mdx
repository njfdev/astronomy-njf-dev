# NJF Astrophotography

Hi there, I am Nicholas Fasching, owner of [njf.dev](https://njf.dev). I am a programmer, but have recently purchased a [Seestar S50 telescope](https://www.seestar.com/) and have gotten into astrophotography. I have always loved astronomy and space, and I hope you'll find this collection of my space photos as astonishing as I do.

## Quick Note

I have just started to make this website, so I will need time to improve it. For now, I will just link all of my photos on this page, but it might be a bit messy.
