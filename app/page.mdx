# NJF Astrophotography

Hi there, I am Nicholas Fasching, owner of [njf.dev](https://njf.dev). I am a programmer, but have recently purchased a [Seestar S50 telescope](https://www.seestar.com/) and have gotten into astrophotography. I have always loved astronomy and space, and I hope you'll find this collection of my space photos as astonishing as I do.

## Quick Note

I have just started to make this website, so I will need time to improve it. I will be adding more photos and videos as I take them, and I will add more features to this website over time.
