# NJF Astrophotography

Hi there, I am Nicholas Fasching, owner of [njf.dev](https://njf.dev). I am a programmer, but have recently purchased a [Seestar S50 telescope](https://www.seestar.com/) and have gotten into astrophotography. I have always loved astronomy and space, and I hope you'll find this collection of my space photos as astonishing as I do.
